Github repository for the manuscript 'A systematic investigation of the common genetic architecture of substance use traits and the relationship with mental health'

Structure:

- FUMA: Contains Manhattan and QQ plots for all three models presented in the manuscript. Bifactor per substance, bifactor per trait, and EFA 4 factor.
  
- Genetic_Correlations: Contains 5 .svg files presenting the genetic correlations of the different factors in each model with other psychiatric, physical, cognitive and social traits.
  
- SEM_plots: Contains the SEM plots for each one of the three models presented in the manuscript.
  
- docs: Contains all the scripts used throughout the project. Scripts 3 to 7 are in .html format and are accessible via the following links:
